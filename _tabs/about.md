Hi! I am Masters Student in [Computer Science at Western](https://csd.uwo.ca) under the co-supervision of [Dr. Augustinus Kistiadi](https://agustinus.kristia.de/) and [Dr. Lucian Ilie](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~ilie/), and a Faculty Affiliate Researcher at [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai). My areas of interest are Deep Learning algorithms and their applications in Bioinformatics.

Outside of academia I spend my time throwing shotput, hammer and weight, building and riding motorcycles, and back-country camping.
