    <h2>1981 Yamaha XS400 Special II Build</h2>
    <h3>Intro, Inspiration, and Initial Purchase</h3>
    <p>Over the past few years I've been watching more and more custom motorcyclce builds online.
      Primarily cafe racers, brat style and scramblers, but also choppers and bobbers.
    </p>
    <figure class="rte-media">

    </figure>
    <p>
      As I wathced these works of art be built, I developped a taste of my own and a vision of my <em>perfect</em>
      motorcyclce.
      I imagined a bike that was a brat style adjacent. Subtly different from the original style, retro, yet modern...
      That's when I encountered BJ from <a href="https://brickhousebuilds.com/">Brick House Builds</a>' XS400:
    </p>
    <figure class="rte-media">
      <img src="bhbxs400.jpg" alt="Image of BrickHouseBuilds XS400" width="250">
      <figcaption class="rte-media-caption">Image of BrickHouseBuilds' XS400</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>This build checks a lot of boxes for me, and ultimately inspired me to start my own build. In particular, I like
      the handlebars, seat, front and rear fenders, and the upswept seat hoop.
      Some things I would change is to keep the original airbox and side covers.
      Not only does that avoid needing to rejet the carbs, I also prefer the look.
      Also, I prefer the wheels to be black, and it needs mirrors.
    </p>
    <p>So, I started shopping for bikes.
      I scrolled Facebook marketplace every day for multiple months, going to see a couple bikes, but never finding
      <em>the one</em>.
      I wasn't specifically shopping for an XS400 either.
      I was open to any 70s or 80s bike, as long as it had the iconic Japanese Universal Motorcycle (JUM) look.
      I also specifiaclly wanted it to have kickstart (I don't know why but kickstarting a road bike is just so cool to
      me).
      I liked the idea of the XS750, or an older Suzuki GS or Honda CB, but none ever popped up in my price range.
      Eventually, an XS400 Special II came up, asking only $600CAD and only a 3 hour drive away.
      It didn't run, and had been sitting for 17 years, but the price was right, it had a clean title and ownership was
      in the seller's posession.
      I went to see it, and met the older couple selling it.
      It was the bike his wife learned to ride on.
      I offered $500CAD, and we settled at $550CAD.

    <h3>The Build Begins!</h3>
    <p>
      I got it home with the help of my uncle, who lives only a half hour from the seller.
      I took it apart, cleaned the 17 year old gas out of the tank and carburetors, and it fired right up!

    </figure>
    <p> I checked the cylinder walls with a boroscope and they look fantastic, crosshatching and everything!
      I measured the compression, getting 120psi on the left and 125psi on the right.
      The engine is healthy and does not require a rebuild! The next step was really stripping it down.
      Removing all the parts I don't indend to use in the final build, and cleaning the bike <em>thoroughy</em> (lots of
      mouse poo, yuck).
    </p>
    <p>After a good clean, I removed the entire wiring harness because I intend to fully rewire the bike to run a modern
      reg/rec, headlight, and LED brake and turn signals.
      I also purchased a <a href="https://www.motogadget.com/en-en/products/mo-unit-blue">Motogadget mo.unit blue</a> to
      really modernize the bike with keyless ignition and the works!
    </p>
    <h3>Rewiring the stator</h3>
    <p>At this point I didn't have a welder or angle grinder yet (for the frame modifications, seat hoop etc.), and
      still have a lot to do before I'm ready to begin
      wiring.
      So, I start some odd jobs. First on the list is fixing the small oil leak coming from the stator wire grommet.
      This is a common failure point on these bikes and unfortunately, you can't get a new grommet anywhere.
      Rewiring, and some silicone gasket maker it is!</p>

      <figcaption class="rte-media-caption">Rewired stator grommet.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>I used 16AWG wire instead of the original 18AWG to ensure a tighter fit through the grommet, just to be safe.
      I applied a conservative amount of red RTV, and reinstalled the stator.
    </p>

    </figure>
    <h3>Polishing the headers</h3>
    <p>Another little job I did around this time was polishing the headers, as the pitting was really not bad.
      I used red scotch-brite and metal polishing compound on most of the pipe, but used the heavy duty green pad for
      the worst of the pitting. They turned out just perfect!
    </p>

    </figure>
    <h3>Upgrading the headlight</h3>
    <p>Continuing with the small jobs, I upgraded the original headlight sealed beam unit to a modern H4 replaceable
      bulb. This was a bit of a funny process, involving the smashing of the original bulb to get it out, and some
      carefull
      dremmel work to make the modern bulb fit nicely. I bent the tabs on the buld and used some more red RTV as some
      glue to make sure it doesn't vibrate itself loose.</p>

      <figcaption class="rte-media-caption">The modified headlight unit</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Painting assorted parts</h3>
    <p>Every so often when I got the chance, I scuffed, cleaned, and painted parts I intended on reusing. Such as foot
      pegs, shifter pedal, rear brake pedal, and the hand levers. I also painted the headlight bucket and battery tray,
      and rear drum. It's not included in the image, but I also painted the kickstand and rear drum support.</p>

      <figcaption class="rte-media-caption">Assorted parts I painted</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Next, I painted the rear wheel. It had some pitting in the chrome, but nothing some scotchbrite and brakleen
      couldn't handle. The before and after are amazing!</p>
